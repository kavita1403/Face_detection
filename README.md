# Face_detection
It involves faces detection using HAAR Cascades in OpenCV and Python.
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with set of input data.
OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for faces, eyes, smiles,etc.
In this project face classifier is used.
